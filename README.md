Greetings!! Welcome to my personal Portfolio Website that I built to showcase my projects and for you to get to know me better as a programmer!! ðŸ˜„

Website Link: https://danielsoesito.com
** Feel free to view this website on your phone! It is mobile friendly**

## Features

- Landing Page with GitHub + LinkedIn links and navigation bar
- About section with introductory paragraph, contact details, and resume
- Projects section with 5 major projects and links/descriptions for each
- Resume section with Education and Work Experience highlights
- Contact form to send me an email and to let me know about yourself!
- Footer for extra navigation capabilities

## Architecture

This website was built with Reat.JS, HTML, CSS, React Redux, and hosted on Hostinger and Vercel. Each component of the app is rendered vertically on top of eachother on the main page, with two extra pages (managed by React Router) for a short thank you messages and viewing my resume.

Resume is viewable without download, but the PDF is also available to download if the user chooses to keep a copy.

Contact form at the end is managed by formsubmit.co, and all messages are sent to my personal email, where I can read the details of the message and respond ASAP.
